  <h2>Research</h2>
<div class="card4">
  <h3>Chip Design</h3>

  <p class="maintext">
    This research was over the hardware for deep learning. 
    The chip has a systolic array of processing elements that 
    preformed the required calculations for more efficient deep 
    learning. My part of that was placement, I created c++ code 
    that took in a Verilog netlist file as well as a DEF file of 
    the processing elements and made a def file with the most 
    optimal placements for the DEF file. It required about parsing 
    through files, graphs and communication with the other people 
    working on other parts of the project.

  <h2>Clubs</h2>
<div class="card">
  <h3>Cybersecurity Club</h3> 

  <p class="maintext">
    In the cybersecurity club I have learned a lot about cybersecurity
    that really pairs well with most of my classes, recently I have
    learning more about penetration testing and different
    vulnerabilities a system can have. It has been a lot of
    fun between the technical workshops and the CTFs and I can
    not wait to do more. <br><br>
    Learn more about it below.

  <h3>Autonobot Team</h3>

  <p class="maintext">
    This team was dedicated to teaching people about deep learning
    and what was required to make models that could identity objects
    in pictures, such as a cone in front of a car. It was a lot of fun
    working on projects, teaching others and learning about fun tools
    that helped along the way.

<div class="card">
  <h3>IEEE</h3>

  <p class="maintext">
    IEEE has been a great place not just to meet friends who are
    mostly in the same major but has also been a great source for
    workshops and company visits that are a lot of fun to go to. I
    am always excited to see what new things I can learn next. <br><br>
