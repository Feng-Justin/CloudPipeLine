  Hi, my name is Justin Feng, I'm a computer engineer with a minor in 
  cybersecurity and mathematics. I love learning about new things and 
  technologies as well as helping others learn and grow along with me.
  I have a ton of analog, digital and software experience loving all 
  of it. I'm a hard worker who is always eager to make the best product 
  I can for the people I'm working for. I'm a great communicator who 
  works great either on a team or leading one. <br><br>
  Throughout high school I loved math and science and so engineering felt like the natural 
  choice of major. Even in high school I had some experience in digital design due to a class 
  about that exact topic. From then on, I knew I wanted to be an electrical engineer. But when 
  I got to college, I had to take an intro python class, which opened me up to the world of 
  software. After that I decided I wanted to learn both hardware and software, so my major 
  became computer engineering where I could learn both sides of computers and technology. 
  Since then, I have been exposed to tons of new subjects and subfields within computer engineering 
  all of which I hope to one day get to know very well.<br><br>
  Other than academics, I also love hanging out with friends in my free time. 
  I enjoy playing sports like soccer and volleyball as well as board/card games such as catan, 
  ticket to ride, exploding kittens, chess and pandemic. I really love games that make you 
  think ahead and use your brain which is why I loved engineering and computer science. They present a problem which makes me think to find the most efficient way to solve it. <br><br>
  Continue to read through my website to learn more about me and what I've done.
